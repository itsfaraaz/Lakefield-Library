# Lakefield Library
This is an application I made for a business competition I placed in. It features a bunch of features that can allow libraries to automate their checkout process. It ended up winning me first place at nationals. With a few modifications and some good testing, it can be modified and fitted to be used in an actual library.

## Notable Features
-   ✅ Open an account from the comfort of your home. Simply scan your student or teacher ID and register directly in the application.
-   ✅ View currently checked out, returned and reserved books. Check for any due or overdue books.
-   ✅ View any overdue fees/current balance.
-   ✅ Skip the counter and scan books to ​self-checkout.
-   ✅ Search for hundreds of thousands of books. Reserve them right inside of the application or check them out.
-   ✅ View the cover, description, and rating of a title right inside search.
-   ✅ View an interactive map of the library.
-   ✅ Bug reporting system​ in case the user finds a bug within the application.
-   ✅ Works to share checkout news to both Facebook and Twitter
-   ✅ Robust application, developed on the ​Firebase Cloud​ powered by Google. All data is stored in secured serves, backed by a powerful Content Delivery Network.
